BPMN/FlowCharts: As a Business Analyst, its was my job to not only gather requirements but translate them into smaller visual components describing how a partilcuar module operates,
who are the key players in that module,how does the data flows, what are the pivots, the decision points, alternate flows, areas of failure.


Mini Case Study:
Lets take an exmaple of an online food delievry app. Here the key players are the customers,restaurants and the riders all of whom are onlboarded as part of the platform.
In an idea situtaion the flow is described as below. 


Start: Customer logs in
    → Browse food options
    → Select and order food
    → Make payment
        → [Decision] Payment successful?
            → Yes: Create order
                → Restaurant receives order notification
                → Restaurant accepts order
                → Prepare food
                → Mark order as ready
                → Notify delivery system / assign driver
                → Driver picks up order
                → Update status: Out for delivery
                → Deliver food to customer
                → Update status: Delivered
                → Send delivery confirmation to customer
                → End: Order completed successfully
            → No: Notify payment failure
                → Return to: Make payment
